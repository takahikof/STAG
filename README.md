# Abstract
While existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of 3D point cloud Transformers attempt to minimize the number of tunable parameters, they still suffer from high temporal and spatial computational costs during fine-tuning. This paper proposes a novel PEFT algorithm called Side Token Adaptation on a neighborhood Graph (STAG) to improve temporal and spatial efficiency. This paper also proposes a benchmark called PCC13, which consists of 13 publicly available labeled 3D point cloud datasets, to enable comprehensive evaluation with diverse point cloud data.
