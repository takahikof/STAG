# Abstract
While existing Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of 3D point cloud Transformers attempt to minimize the number of tunable parameters, they still suffer from high temporal and spatial computational costs. This paper proposes a novel PEFT algorithm for 3D point cloud Transformers, called Side Token Adaptation on a neighborhood Graph (STAG), to achieve superior temporal and spatial efficiency.
